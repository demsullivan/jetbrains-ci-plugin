## JetBrains CI Integration

This project is a plugin for all JetBrains IntelliJ-based IDEs that integrates with
all popular CI services.

Currently it's in development, and the first release will only support CircleCI. In the future,
I'd also like to add support for Heroku CI and Travis CI.

Other services to be added by request.

### TODO for v1

* ~~Reasonably easy user setup via Settings~~
* ~~View all project builds~~
* ~~View all steps for a given build~~
* ~~Open a link to the commit or build page~~
* Restart a build
* Refresh button
* Move API requests into background tasks
* Refresh tool window when settings are changed

### Future wishlist

* Inspect build step output
* Support for Heroku CI
* Support for Travis CI
* Tight IDE integration
    * Hyperlinks to lines of code
    * Build failure inspection tools
